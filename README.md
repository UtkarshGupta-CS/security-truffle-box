# Truffle Security
This is a [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) [Box](http://truffleframework.com/boxes/) providing the security infrastructure for your DApp backend.

It aims to be a single box that meets all your requirements to write secure solidity smart contracts and is [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium)'s official box for Truffle.

## Available Integrations
- [Style](http://solium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#list-of-core-rules) & [Security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/solium-plugin-security#list-of-rules) linting with [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium)

## Roadmap
- [Zeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) as dependancy
- Support for Zeppelin's [contract upgrading pattern](https://blog.zeppelin.solutions/proxy-libraries-in-solidity-79fbe4b970fd)
- Security analysis using [Oyente](https://github.com/melonproject/oyente)

## Contributions
We aim for this project to be community-governed. We therefore invite one and all to suggest improvements and features, assist us on Licensing issues, discuss the future of DApp security and contribute in any way you can!
